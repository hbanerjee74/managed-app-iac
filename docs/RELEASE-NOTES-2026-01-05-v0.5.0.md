# Release Notes — v0.5.0 (2026-01-05)

## RFC-71 Deterministic Naming Implementation

**Note:** This release contains no functional changes. It implements RFC-71 deterministic naming conventions across all resources. Resource names change to follow the new naming pattern, but all functionality remains identical. Existing deployments will continue to work, and new deployments will use the updated naming conventions.
