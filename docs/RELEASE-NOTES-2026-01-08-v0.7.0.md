# Release Notes — v0.7.0 (2026-01-08)

## Module Refactoring: Split Security Module into Focused Modules

**Note:** This release contains no functional changes. It is a pure code reorganization that splits the `security.bicep` module into three focused modules (`kv.bicep`, `storage.bicep`, `acr.bicep`) for better maintainability. All resources deploy identically to previous versions.
